This example demonstrates the use of timers, pwm and gamma correction on on LED
on the eval board.

It's intended for the 1BitSquared 1BitSy STM32F415 eval board. 

This program will light up the LED on the eval board. And continously adjust
the pwm value to produce a fading effect. The fading is adjusted with a 2.2
gamma value correction table that results in a smooth distribution of
brightness.
